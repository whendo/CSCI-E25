        "Wireless tower crews have an expensive and sensitive ecological issue in many regions of the world. The issue is migratory bird paths which coincide with tower sites.\n",
        "\n",
        "Migratory birds are protected by many environmental laws and procedures to ensure their safety and to avoid disturbing them in their natural environment as much as possible. This means specialty crews that must be used to handle work on the tower, or for them to relocate the animals to a safer place for work to continue. These crews are not cheap, so many wireless providers are using camera drones to collect information about the state of the tower and any wildlife that may reside there currently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since drone piloting and birdwatching and identification arenâ€™t necessarily intersecting skill sets, a binary classifier stating if a protected bird is in or on the tower could be a cost saving tool for wireless providers to use, giving timely advice for field teams to base their activities.\n"

The proposed project will act as a proof of concept to build a model that will classify if a bird is covered under Title 50 Part 10.13 or not. This model will make use of initial data set sorting and management, image preprocessing, feature extraction, and a multilayer convolutional neural network. Particular focus will be paid to minimizing false negatives, which could be dangerous for the protected bird and expensive for the company using the tool. The training and test data set come from a public data set."

This reordering will make the classification very clear when we get to it, as well as save us some code later when analyzing performance."
